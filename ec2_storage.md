# **EC2 Storage Overview**

# **Elastic Block Store (EBS)**

### **Overview**
Amazon EBS is a persistent block storage service designed for EC2 instances. It provides high availability and durability, with data stored across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). EBS volumes can be attached to any EC2 instance in the same AZ.

---

### **Types of EBS Volumes**
1. **General Purpose SSD (gp3/gp2)**:
   - Balanced price and performance for general workloads.
   - Use Case: Boot volumes, small to medium databases.

2. **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2)**:
   - High-performance volumes for I/O-intensive applications.
   - Use Case: Databases requiring low-latency, high IOPS.

3. **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)**:
   - Designed for high-throughput workloads.
   - Use Case: Big data, log processing, large datasets.

4. **Cold HDD (sc1)**:
   - Cost-effective storage for infrequently accessed data.
   - Use Case: Cold storage, file archiving.

---

### **Key Features**
- **Snapshots**: EBS volumes can be backed up as point-in-time snapshots to Amazon S3 for durability and easy restoration.
- **Encryption**: EBS volumes support encryption at rest and in transit.
- **Elasticity**: You can increase volume size or change types without downtime.

---

### **Use Cases**
- Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) with consistent I/O needs.
- Boot volumes for EC2 instances.
- Storage for critical applications requiring durability and reliability.

# **EBS Snapshots**

### **Overview**
EBS Snapshots are point-in-time backups of Amazon EBS volumes. These backups are stored by AWS and allow you to create new volumes or restore an existing volume to its previous state.

---

### **Key Features**
- **Incremental**: Only the changed data since the last snapshot is saved, reducing storage costs.
- **Cross-Region Copy**: Snapshots can be copied to other AWS regions for disaster recovery or migration.
- **Encryption**: Snapshots retain the encryption settings of the original volume.

---

### **Use Cases**
- Disaster recovery, backup, and creating test environments.
# **Additional EBS Features**

### **Performance Modes**:
- **GP3**: Offers baseline IOPS and throughput, but you can provision additional performance.
- **Provisioned IOPS (io1/io2)**: Consistent, high-performance volumes for I/O-heavy applications.

### **Elastic Volumes**:
- EBS volumes can be resized, and performance characteristics can be changed without detaching the volume, offering flexibility without downtime.

### **Snapshots Lifecycle**:
- Use **Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager** to automate and manage EBS snapshot creation and retention.

### **Multi-Attach (io1/io2)**:
- Enables multiple EC2 instances to attach to the same EBS volume for high availability.
# **Elastic File System (EFS)**

### **Overview**
Amazon EFS is a scalable, managed file storage system for Linux workloads, offering shared access to multiple EC2 instances. It automatically scales with your data needs and provides high availability across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

---

### **Key Features**
- **Elastic Scaling**: Automatically adjusts capacity as data is added or removed.
- **Multi-AZ Availability**: Ensures high availability and redundancy.
- **Performance Modes**: 
  - **General Purpose** for low-latency.
  - **Max I/O** for high throughput.
- **Storage Classes**: 
  - **Standard** for frequently accessed data.
  - **Infrequent Access (IA)** for cost-effective storage of infrequently accessed data.

---

### **Access & Security**
- **POSIX-compliant**: Supports Unix/Linux file permissions and directory structure, ensuring compatibility for Linux workloads.
- **VPC Security**: Controlled via VPC security groups.
- **Cross-Region and On-Premises Access**: Can be accessed from AWS or on-premises via Direct Connect.

---

### **Use Cases**
- Web serving, content management, big data analytics, shared development environments, and machine learning workloads.

# **EC2 Instance Store**

### **Overview**
EC2 Instance Store provides temporary, high-performance storage directly attached to the physical host where an instance runs. Unlike EBS, data in instance store is ephemeral and is lost if the instance is stopped, terminated, or fails.

---

### **Key Features**
- **Ephemeral**: Data persists only during the instance's lifetime.
- **High Performance**: Ideal for low-latency, high-speed storage.
- **No Cost**: Included with the instance type.

---

### **Use Cases**
- Temporary data storage, such as caches, buffers, or scratch data.
